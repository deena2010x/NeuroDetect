# Visual-and-Predictive-Analysis-of-Brain-Tumors-from-MRI-Using-Machine-Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system that can analyze MRI scans to detect and classify brain tumors. It leverages a combination of image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to assist in early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary adenomas.

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset used is the Brain Tumor MRI Scan Dataset, which consists of:

Positive Class (tumor present): Includes MRI scans labeled with glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor images.

Negative Class (no tumor): Includes healthy brain MRI scans for baseline comparison.

These images are used to train, validate, and test machine learning models for classification tasks.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🧪 Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Image resizing and normalization

Data augmentation (optional)

Feature Extraction

Grayscale conversion

Histogram analysis

Edge detection techniques (e.g., Canny)

Model Training

Models: SVM, Random Forest, KNN

Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

Visualization

Tumor highlighting using bounding techniques

Model performance plots

📊 Results
The model achieves high accuracy in differentiating between tumor and non-tumor images. Feature visualization and evaluation metrics are used to validate the model's performance across various scenarios.

🧠 Future Work
Integrate deep learning (e.g., CNNs) for improved accuracy.

Classify tumor types and severity.

Build a web interface or diagnostic app for practical usability.
